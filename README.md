# LSB-Image-Steganography
This project implements image steganography in C by hiding a secret text file inside an uncompressed BMP image using LSB (Least Significant Bit) manipulation. It securely embeds and later extracts hidden data without visually altering the image, preserving both data privacy and image integrity.
